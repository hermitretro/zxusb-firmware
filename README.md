# Building the firmware

The firmware is designed to be built using `platformio`. You can read
about this tool at [https://platformio.org/](https://platformio.org/).

The firmware can also be built within the standard Arduino IDE which can
be downloaded from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). The only required non-core module is `Keyboard`.

The firmware can be flashed directly onto the ZXUSB board via the attached
USB cable.
